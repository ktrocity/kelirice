        <p>I am a Creative Designer with an educational and professional background that spans architecture, user experience design, and human-computer interaction design in complex technical environments.</p>
        <p>My favorite design problems exist where technology meets space, and my diverse background helps me bridge the gaps that my clients often encounter. I work with end-users to make their interactions with technology a positive experience, and find ways to create digital solutions that are responsive to their needs, functional, and well-designed. My education and experience in architecture gave me a foundation in organizational planning and design thinking, which flows directly into my work in experiential design problems.</p>
        <p>Over the years I have learned a lot about the design development of technology systems, with an emphasis on user experience and interaction design principles, which I have applied across a growing and broader gamut of projects. Every day I get to collaborate with some truly talented individuals on technology systems that control audio, video, and more in a wide array of human-centered environments.</p>
